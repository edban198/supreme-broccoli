RB.jl - runs a Rayleigh-Benard convection simulation with various boundary conditions in z.

23/1
convection - [goluskin] mean temps? 
rotating convection(L.C) 
convection + surface wave forcing (+rotate)

assignment inertial wave - force at top and get them to propagate k_z z + ft; P=b=0
-check wave set up
